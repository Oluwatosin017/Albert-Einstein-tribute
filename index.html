        <h3>One of the greatest scientists to have ever lived.</h3>
        <p>Albert Einstein, 
            <span class="long-history-about-baba-einstein">
            (born March 14, 1879, Ulm, Wurttemberg, Germany - died April 18, 1955, Princeton, New Jersey, U.S), German-born physicist who developed the special and general theories of relativity and won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect. Einstein is generally considered the most influential physicist of the 20th century.
