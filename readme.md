# Tribute Page

## Name of Project
This is a personal project dedicated to the tribute of Albert Einstein

## Reasons
I chose him because i aspire to be like him. He was one of the greates physicist of all time and changed the world. He was super smart and created the atomic bomb with his infamous equation "E = MC^2"

## Typography & Styling

### Color

- blue

### Background-color

- black

### Font

- Open Sans.

## Reasons for Implementation
I chose the color black to imitate the presence of a dark mode screen. I did this because and we are in the 21st century and most phones run on Android 10 and higher which have the capability of dark mode.

## Challenges
I have issues importing the font from google fonts and aligning the image as i had to waste hours on google search engine.

## Expectations
In my upcoming weeks or tasks as an wejapa intern, i hope to be much better at styling and creating unique and responsive apps.
